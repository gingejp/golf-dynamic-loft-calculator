  <p class="tool-note">
  This tool provides a simplified estimation of dynamic loft, based from your own swing speed and carry distance.<br/>
  It’s designed to estimate how much dynamic loft is offered at impact and to highlight the difference from a scratch golfer.<br/>
  It's simple by design and assumptions have been made, such as a clean strike. It is clearly not supposed to be as accurate as launch monitor data.<br/>
  Static loft consists of shaft lean angle and the angle of attack. There is no way of knowing how much is due to each, with this simple estimation.<br/>
  Several tools can be found online to estimate distance from swing speed, but this tool is unique for estimating dynamic loft.<br/>
  Explanations are provided for what dynamic loft is and how it affects your distance, but there would be no value in detailed suggestions <br/>
  on how to improve technique. The best thing to do is seek the help of a professional.

    <h2>What Is Dynamic Loft and Why Is It Important?</h2>
    <p><strong>Dynamic loft</strong> is the angle of the clubface at the moment of contact with the ball. It differs from <em>static loft</em>, which is the club’s built-in angle when stationary. Dynamic loft is influenced by how the golfer swings, wrist position, shaft lean and angle of attack.</p>
    <p><strong>Why dynamic loft matters:</strong> It controls the initial height (launch angle) and spin of the ball. Too much dynamic loft sends the ball too high, causing excess spin and loss of distance. Too little loft produces low shots that may roll out too far and be hard to control. Finding the right dynamic loft helps maximize distance and accuracy by ensuring an optimal ball flight.</p>
    <p>It also reflects <strong>swing efficiency</strong>. Golfers who “cast” or flip their wrists often offer too muc dynamic loft, leading to weaker shots and less distance than optimal. Conversely, players who maintain proper shaft lean deliver lower dynamic loft for better compression and distance.</p>
    <p>Different clubs and shots require different dynamic lofts. Drivers benefit from lower dynamic loft and a positive angle of attack to maximize distance, while wedges need higher loft for control and spin.</p>
    <p><strong>In summary:</strong> Dynamic loft is a key factor in shot consistency, distance, and control. Learning to manage it helps golfers improve ball flight and overall performance on the course.</p>

      <p class="caption">Casting v Compession</p>	
      <p>The illustration above shows the difference, between body and club position when casting, or good compression.
		The golfer needs to have his weight towards his lead foot and his hands well forward at point of impact.<br>
        Obtaining better compression often requires hands-on swing analysis. Consider booking a lesson with a qualified golf pro to refine these body mechanics.<br>
        If this tool is showing far more dynamic loft than ideal, you'll almost certainly benefit from a few lessons.
